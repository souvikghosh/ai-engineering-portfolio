# AI Engineering Portfolio - Learning Path

**Goal:** Become an employable AI Engineer through hands-on projects.

**Approach:** GenAI First → Master GenAI → Agentic AI → DS Fundamentals (as needed)

---

## Phase 1: GenAI Fundamentals
*Learn to work with LLM APIs, prompt engineering, and basic patterns*

| # | Project | Key Skills | Status |
|---|---------|------------|--------|
| 01 | **Commit Message Generator** | API basics, CLI tools, prompt engineering | ⬜ |
| 02 | **Code Explainer CLI** | Structured outputs, code understanding | ⬜ |
| 03 | **README Generator** | File I/O, markdown, practical automation | ⬜ |

---

## Phase 2: Intermediate GenAI
*Embeddings, RAG, streaming, and production patterns*

| # | Project | Key Skills | Status |
|---|---------|------------|--------|
| 04 | **Semantic Code Search** | Embeddings, vector similarity, indexing | ⬜ |
| 05 | **Multi-Provider Chat** | Multiple APIs, streaming, error handling | ⬜ |
| 06 | **Codebase Q&A (RAG)** | Chunking, retrieval, context management | ⬜ |

---

## Phase 3: Agentic AI
*Agents, tool use, multi-step reasoning, orchestration*

| # | Project | Key Skills | Status |
|---|---------|------------|--------|
| 07 | **Shell Commander Agent** | Function calling, tool use, safety | ⬜ |
| 08 | **Code Review Agent** | Multi-step analysis, file operations | ⬜ |
| 09 | **PR Description Agent** | Git integration, multi-agent patterns | ⬜ |

---

## Phase 4: DS Fundamentals Applied
*Statistics, evaluation, and understanding what's under the hood*

| # | Project | Key Skills | Status |
|---|---------|------------|--------|
| 10 | **Embedding Explorer** | Dimensionality reduction, clustering, viz | ⬜ |
| 11 | **Prompt Evaluator** | Metrics, A/B testing, statistical analysis | ⬜ |
| 12 | **AI Dev Assistant (Capstone)** | Full integration, production-ready tool | ⬜ |

## How to Use This Repo

1. Work through projects in order (they build on each other)
2. Each project has its own folder with:
   - `README.md` - Requirements and learning objectives
   - `LEARN.md` - Concepts to understand before/during
   - Starter code and tests
3. Complete each project before moving to the next
4. Push your solutions to showcase on GitHub
